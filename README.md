* Dependency injection with [Hilt](https://dagger.dev/hilt/)
* [Kotlin Coroutines](https://kotlinlang.org/docs/coroutines-guide.html) and [Kotlin Flow](https://kotlinlang.org/docs/flow.html) for an asynchronous development
* Use of many [Android Architecture Components](https://developer.android.com/topic/libraries/architecture/) throughout the project
